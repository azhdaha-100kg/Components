#		-Interrupt: Interrupt is a hardware mechanism in which, the device notices the CPU that it requires its attention./
#			Interrupt can take place at any time. So when CPU gets an interrupt signal trough the indication interrupt-request line,/
#			CPU stops the current process and respond to the interrupt by passing the control to interrupt handler which services device.
#	    -Polling: In polling is not a hardware mechanism, its a protocol in which CPU steadily checks whether the device needs attention./
#			Wherever device tells process unit that it desires hardware processing, #in polling process unit keeps asking the I/O device whether or not it desires CPU processing./
#			The CPU ceaselessly check every and each device hooked up thereto for sleuthing whether or not any device desires hardware attention.
